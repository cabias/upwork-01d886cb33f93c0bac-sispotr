<p>This tool allows researchers to determine the off-targeting potential for
siRNAs they have already designed. Input can be a list of sequences,
separated by a line break, corresponding to the <em>antisense</em>
sequence. Output not only provides the POTS for the siRNA, but also a
percentile score that shows the percent of seed sequences with worse
POTS values.</p>
