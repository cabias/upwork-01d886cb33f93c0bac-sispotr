#siSPOTR Project
===============
##With the siSPOTR tools you can: 
* Identify candidate siRNA/shRNA sequences for your gene of interest with a low potential for off-targeting.
* Evaluate the off-targeting potential for any RNAi sequence.
* View a list of all predicted off-targets for siRNA candidates, along with information on the site-type composition and probability of being off-targeted.
* BLAST your sequence to search for siRNA-like on/off-targeting


##Components
siSPOTR Project is made of four major components
* [JNISuffixTrieNative](https://github.com/ui-icts/sispotr-project/tree/master/JNISuffixNative) - navive c version of the Trie
* [base](https://github.com/ui-icts/sispotr-project/tree/master/base) - Database Access layer
* [webapp](https://github.com/ui-icts/sispotr-project/tree/master/webapp) - JAVA Spring/Hibernate Application
